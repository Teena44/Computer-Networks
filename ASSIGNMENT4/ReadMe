Assignment 4

Steps to compile TCP.c file

1.Type the command "make" in terminal from the current directory which contains all the source files and make file.

Steps to run the files:

1.Run the ith file along with the following command line parameters in the given order-
		Ki : 1 ≤ Ki ≤ 4 denotes the initial congestion window (CW)
		Km : 0:5 ≤ Km ≤ 2 denotes the multiplier of Congestion Window, during exponential growth phase
		Kn: 0:5 ≤ Kn ≤ 2 denotes the multiplier of Congestion Window, during linear growth phase
		Kf :  0:1 ≤ Kf ≤ 0:5 denotes the multiplier when a timeout occurs
		P :  0 < Ps < 1, denotes the probability of receiving the ACK packet for a given segment before its timeout occurs
		T : the total number of segments to be sent before the emulation stops

		$ ./TCP Ki Km Kn Kf P T

		Example (Ki = 1, Km = 1, Kn = 1, Kf = 0.5, P = 0.01, T = 1000 ):

		$./TCP 1 1 1 0.5 0.01 1000
