Assignment 1

Steps to compile the server.c and client.c files
1.Type the command "make all" in terminal.

Steps to run the files:

1.Run server.c - ./server 8080
2.Run client.c in a separate terminal - ./client 8080

Working:

All the commands are supposed to be given in the client terminal through the Main-Prompt. 
The valid commands are (The commands are to be given in exactly the same way as mentioned)-
1.Listusers - Lists all the users.
2.Adduser <user> - A new user can be added. A new spool file is created.
3.Setuser <user> - The control goes to <user>. A Sub-Prompt appears, in which the commands "Read", "Send", "Delete", "Done" are given.
4.Read - Reads one mail at each "Read" command given, of the current user.
5.Send <receiver> - After giving this command, the server demands the message to be sent to <receiver>. 
		    NOTE: For the mail to be valid, the message has to end with a space followed by "###".
6.Delete - The current message is deleted from the user's inbox.
8.Done - The user is done. No user in control.
9.Quit - The server and client disconnect. The programs stop runnning.

NOTE: The commands Read, Delete, Done, Send are valid only if the user is set.
The server and client throw "ERROR" if a command is passed which does not match any of the above mentioned commands.

The spool files related to each user, is created in the MAILSERVER directory. The server reads, writes and deletes messages as specified by
the user from these spool files.
